- ⚡ Fast and simple interface.
- 🧠 Built using basic NLP techniques (customizable to use advanced models like Transformers).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python

Let me know if:
- You want a **shorter version**
- Your summarizer uses a **GUI (e.g., Streamlit)** and you'd like to reflect that
- You want to include sample input/output screenshots or demos

Happy documenting!
